# Rule Validation API

This API is used to validate a set of data using predefined rules.
It has two end points - the base endpoint and the rule validation endpoint.
The rule validation endpoint helps to validate passed data against a defined rule.

**How the API works**

```
For the data field, I used JSON object as my accepted request body.
So, the validation endpoint will validate all the rules against JSON object payload
